## JMVFG: Joint Multi-view Unsupervised Feature Selection and Graph Learning

This is the source code for the JMVFG algorithm, which is proposed in the following paper:

Si-Guo Fang, Dong Huang, Chang-Dong Wang, Yong Tang.  
Joint Multi-view Unsupervised Feature Selection and Graph Learning,  
IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence, accepted, 2023.

Run "demo_1_multiview_clustering.m" to test the JMVFG algorithm for the multi-view clustering task, or "demo_2_feature_selection.m" for the multi-view unsupervised feature selection task.
